# 7th DubsTech Datathon

The DubsTech Datathon is the University of Washington’s first homegrown data science hackathon, bringing together curious minds, creative problem-solvers, and data enthusiasts from across campus and beyond.

## Introduction
My name is Jah Chen. I am from team **Solo Silo 🚀**. As the name suggests, I will be soloing this competition all by my lonesome to test my limit on how much I can accomplish as a data scientist in this tight 24-hour window. 

The prompt I will be tackling in this competition is [Access to Technology](https://www.notion.so/dubstech-datathon/Access-to-Technology-2fd46885930c80509110dccef10a94bd)
