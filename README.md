# 7th DubsTech Datathon 🎉

The DubsTech Datathon is the University of Washington’s first homegrown data science hackathon, bringing together curious minds, creative problem-solvers, and data enthusiasts from across campus and beyond. More details can be viewed [**here**](https://www.notion.so/dubstech-datathon/Welcome-to-the-7th-DubsTech-Datathon-2f546885930c802f9bb7e6eff71b2354).

## Introduction 💻
Hello judges, industry experts, and fellow data enthusiasts! My name is Jah Chen. I am from team **Solo Silo 🚀**. As the name suggests, I am soloing this competition all by my lonesome to test my limit on how much I can accomplish as a data scientist in this tight 24-hour window. 

The prompt I am be tackling in this competition is [**Access to Technology**](https://www.notion.so/dubstech-datathon/Access-to-Technology-2fd46885930c80509110dccef10a94bd) with the dataset I am using sourced from [**AccessGuru**](https://b2find.eudat.eu/dataset/e0aa764f-959c-51a9-9f39-60ac02bbb1c7).

## Prompts 🎯
> Which domains (health, education, government, etc.) have the highest number of accessibility violations?

> What violation types are most common across domains?

> Which web domain has the most severe accessibility issues?

> How can we cluster websites based on similarity in violation patterns to identify “high-risk” domains?

## Exploration Guide 📊
This repository uses `uv` package manager to manage dependencies for faster installation, but standard `pip` works as well. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Everything you need to see lives in the `presentation` folder:
*   `Exploration.pdf`: PDF version of the data exploration notebook.
*   `Exploration.html`: HTML version of the dataexploration notebook.
*   `Learning.pdf`: PDF version of the machine learning notebook.
*   `Learning.html`: HTML version of the machine learning notebook.
*   `Presentation.pptx`: The main slide deck.
*   `Presentation.mp4`: A video walkthrough of the presentation.

Additionally, check out the `data` folder if you want to run the code yourself! Just make sure to run `Exploration.ipynb` before `Learning.ipynb`.

## Limitations 🚧
While this analysis provides valuable insights into web accessibility, there are several limitations to consider:

*   **Data Imputation**: Missing values in categorical fields (e.g., `violation_category`) were imputed using the mode. This assumption simplifies the data preparation but might introduce bias if the missingness is correlated with specific website types.
*   **Scraping Bias**: The study is restricted to websites that were successfully scraped. Domains with strict anti-bot measures or severe technical errors prevented data collection, potentially excluding a subset of "high-risk" or highly secured websites from the findings.
*   **Unsupervised Specificity**: The clustering and risk identification rely on unsupervised machine learning. Without ground-truth labels for "accessibility risk," the defined clusters are interpretative based on engineered features (e.g., violation severity, frequency) rather than external validation.
*   **Aggregation Smoothing**: Aggregating metrics to the domain level (using medians and percentiles) helps identify systemic issues but may obscure isolated yet critical violations on specific low-traffic pages.

## Future Work 🌎
This project highlights the systemic nature of web accessibility violations across major sectors. By moving beyond simple counts to severity-weighted clustering, we can better prioritize remediation efforts where they are most needed.

**Future improvements could include:**
*   **Temporal Analysis**: Tracking violation trends over time to measure the impact of remediation efforts.
*   **Real-time Scoring**: Developing a browser extension that uses the trained cluster models to assess website accessibility risk in real-time.
*   **Broadened Scope**: Expanding the dataset to include more diverse international domains and niche industries.
